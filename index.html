        <p>
            <b> Elon Musk is planning to soon launch the prototype of a vehicle that could be a game-changer for space travel. Starship, as it's known, will be a fully reusable transport system capable of carrying up to 100 people to the Red Planet.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            The founding ethos of Elon Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX was to make life multi-planetary. This is partly motivated by existential threats such as an asteroid collision big enough to wipe out humanity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Settling other planets would place some of the eggs in other baskets, sparing human civilisation if one of them were to experience a cataclysm.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2016, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7Uyfqi_TE8" target="_blank"> <b>the entrepreneur outlined his rationale</b></a> at an international conference in Mexico: "History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event," he said.
        </p>

        <i>
            "The alternative is to become a spacefaring civilisation and a multi-planet species, which I hope you would agree is the right way to go."
        </i>

        <p>
            Musk has often spoken about his dream of building cities on Mars. He believes that settlements would need large numbers of people in order to become self-sustaining.

        <h2>When will it fly?</h2>
          

        <p>
            In the last few years, SpaceX has tested various prototypes of the Starship upper stage at its Boca Chica facility in Texas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The company started off with a 39m-tall "test article" called Starhopper, which bore a passing resemblance to a water tower. Since flying this vehicle to 150m above ground, SpaceX has been developing increasingly complex Starship prototypes.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In December 2020, SpaceX launched a test article named SN8 (Starship number 8) - the first to feature a nosecone and flaps. After reaching an altitude of 12.5km, SN8 belly flopped back to Earth, giving SpaceX valuable engineering data about the final part of Starship's return from space.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was almost a textbook flight, but the vehicle approached the landing pad a little too fast and hard, causing it to crumple and explode. SpaceX has already moved prototype SN9 to the launch pad, and, this time, they're aiming to stick the landing.
        </p>

        <p>
            In October 2020, Elon Musk said SpaceX was aiming to launch Starship <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-first-mars-trip-2024" target="blank_"> <b>on an uncrewed flight to Mars in 2024. </b></a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Some observers note that Mr Musk's timelines are sometimes optimistic. But he has also developed a reputation for eventually achieving his goals, no matter how ambitious.
